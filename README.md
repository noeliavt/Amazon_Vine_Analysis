## Sumary

* Our dataset is for Music and there is zero paid 5 start reviews. It seems like companies don't pay for gift card reviews.  
* On the contrary the Unpaid reviews has 87% positive reviews. So even unpaid reviews are also very positive.

We could perform the similar analysis for next best rating - (rating 4) and see if there is any bias since it's hard to detremine bias as there is not enough data to conclude paid reviews.
